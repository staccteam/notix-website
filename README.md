### Website for Notix  
**Notix is a notification platform for [Hitkarini College of Engineering and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitkarini_College_of_Engineering_and_Technology)**  

### REST API

Everything is packed with its REST API that you may need to create any application. All the required data could be gathered easily with the help of asynchronous request to the process file. Some useful things that you may need during the development-

* To get the branch name by branch ID, you could simply query the data with a simple get request to this URL `http://hcetnotix.azurewebsites.net/process/getBranchNameByID/pass-id-here`
* To get all notifications, use this url `http://hcetnotix.azurewebsites.net/process/getNotifications/json/branch-name`
* To get Single Notification by ID, use this URL `http://hcetnotix.azurewebsites.net/precess/getSingleNotification/pass-notification-id`

You can check more in the process.php file.

#### Current Features:  
* A console for faculty members of the college to create notifications file distribution support.
* An Admin CRUD system to manage users, content and access to the site.
* Scalable model to compensate vast changes and updates when requested.
* Fully featured, responsive Front-end for on the go easy mobile access.
